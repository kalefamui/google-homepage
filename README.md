Testing HTML and CSS (The Odin Project)

A little apresentation what's is this project:

For this mini-project, you’ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. Don’t worry if the links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when you submit it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.

Using the browser’s developer tools (right clicking something on the page and clicking “inspect element” will get you there) will be your best friend. Build the page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out

Easy Version: Build the Google.com homepage

Difficult Version (optional): Build the Google.com search results page
